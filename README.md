Scientific Calculator using Arduino Uno
In this, we are trying to make a calculator using Arduino as microcontroller, 4x4 Keypad as input and LCD as output. This is implementated using TinkerCad Stimualtion software and Eagle EAD software for PCB Design.

Part 1: Components
Components	Use / Functioning
Arduino Uno	Microcontroller
LCD	Displaying Unit - Result
Keypad	Taking Input from Users
Potentiometer	Setting LCD Contrast
Resistor	Backlight Adjustment of LCD
Part 2: Software Implementation
Operations Performed:
Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division
Square root and Square of a number
Logarithm(base of 10) and Exponent(e^number)
Trigonometry (Sine and Cosine functions)
BODMAS operation

Part 3: Working
After simulation, we press a no. between 1 to 11 to select an operation.

Case-1: If the selected no. is from 1 to 4 then an operation is selected, then we press any no. as the first operand and then we press “D”, so that it stop taking input for the 1st operand, then we press other no. as the second operand, then we again press “D” to stop taking input for the second operand and then the output is displayed on the LCD.

Case-2: If the selected no. is from 5 to 10 then an operation is selected, then we press any no. as the first operand and then we press “D” to stop taking input for the operand and then the output is displayed on the LCD.

Case-3: If the selected no. is equal to 11, it means we have selected the BODMAS operation, i.e. for the BODMAS operation, we first press “A”, to get input operand, then after taking 1st operand as input, we press “D”, for stop taking input for the 1st operand, then we press “C” to choose the operation to be carried out from choices 1 to 5, and then we press “D” for stop taking input for the second operand and to take the input of the next operand, and then the process is continued till the user completes giving input. At-last we press “B” to get the desired result on the LCD.

For every new computation, press D and wait till the LCD display goes blank (delay). Then, again we start by selecting any option from 1 to 11.

Part 4: PCB Design
The PCB Designing involves 3 steps:

Download the .BRD file from Tinkercad and Open it on EAGLE or any other EDA software
Rearrange the components to ensure minimum space utilization
Perform Manual Routing over the Airwires in the design

Conclusion
Thus, we have connected and successfully demonstrated a scientific calculator with different operations as well as different number of operands with Arduino Uno using Tinkercad circuits simulator and Eagle Designing Software.

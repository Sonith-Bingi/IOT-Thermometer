## IOT Thermometer using [Arduino Uno](https://www.arduino.cc/)

In this, we are trying to make a Thermometer using Arduino as a microcontroller and LCD as output.Â This is implemented using TinkerCad Simulation software and Thingspeak.com for storing and displaying the data continuously.

### Part 1: Components

|         Components          |                  Use / Functioning                          |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Arduino Uno                 | Microcontroller                                             |
| Temperature Sensor          | Backlight Adjustment of LCD                                 |
| LCD                         | Displaying Unit - Result                                    |
| Wifi module (ESP8266)       | Taking Input from Users                                     |
| Potentiometer               | Setting LCD Contrast                                        |
| Resistor                    | Backlight Adjustment of LCD                                 |

### Part 2: Working

After simulation, the circuit is in working condition and is continuously taking the input from the temperature sensor that input is loaded into the Wi-Fi module, and the data is stored in a cloud and analyzed in different ways like using widgets (Bar Graph, Line Graph, Gauge meter, etc) using a website: Thingspeak.com

### Conclusion

Thus, we have connected and successfully demonstrated an IOT Thermometer with different visualizing widgets as well as a different number of operands with Arduino Uno using the Tinkercad circuits simulator and Thingspeak.com website.

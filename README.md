## IOT Thermometer using [Arduino Uno](https://www.arduino.cc/)

In this, we are trying to make a Thermometer using Arduino as microcontrolle and LCD as output.Â This is implementated using TinkerCad Stimualtion software and Thingspeak.com for storing and displaying the data continuously.

### Part 1: Components

|         Components          |                  Use / Functioning                          |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Arduino Uno                 | Microcontroller                                             |
| Temperature Sensor          | Backlight Adjustment of LCD                                 |
| LCD                         | Displaying Unit - Result                                    |
| Wifi module (ESP8266)       | Taking Input from Users                                     |
| Potentiometer               | Setting LCD Contrast                                        |
| Resistor                    | Backlight Adjustment of LCD                                 |

### Part 2: Working

After simulation, the circuit is n working condidtion and is continously taking the input from temperature sensor and that input is being loaded into the Wifi Module and the data is stored a cloud and analysed in different ways like using widgets (Bar Graph, Line Graph, Gauge meter etc.) using a website: Thingspeak.com

### Conclusion

Thus, we have connected and successfully demonstrated an IOT Thermometer with different visualising widgets as well as different number of operands with Arduino Uno using Tinkercad circuits simulator and Thingspeak.com website.
